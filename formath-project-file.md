#Formath
Formath is a linear algebra framework that is focused on implementing the fundamental numerical linear algebra procedures. Formath includes a vector and matrix types which model rank1 and rank2 arrays, respectively. These types allow for the modularization of vector and matrix operations.

@Note This Library is a work in process and is the process of me learning how to implement fundamental numerical algorithms from the ground up. This package is currently configured to my system, as it is intended principally as a learning experience.
